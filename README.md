### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adrian, and I'm a Technical Support Engineer for Electron Beam Inspection Machines. I work with data and create applications mainly about python, automation, and data visualization. I have a passion for designing software applications to optimize processes, automate workflows, and improve operational efficiency.

### Projects I'm working on:

1. [cookiecutter-tkinterapp](https://github.com/spydermaxi/cookiecutter-tkinterapp)

   This is a small project I plan to build to get started quickly with any Tkinter application that works on top of [pygubu-designer](https://github.com/alejandroautalan/pygubu-designer) by [alejandroautalan](https://github.com/alejandroautalan).

2. [TraqWhel](https://github.com/spydermaxi/TraqWhel)

   Used to be called TINT - Tyre Inventory & Tracking App for Freight Transport businesses looking to track tire records and usage.

2. Proactive Monitoring Project

   This project automates data collection, visualization, and delivery to provide Engineers with the information to make proactive decisions to prevent unscheduled downtime situations.

3. Uptime Converter

   This application converts SEMI E10 equipment up/downtime in Thursday workweek format to ISO. The application also includes data analysis and visualization functions.

4. Personal Blog

   This is going to be a collection of my learnings professionally and personally. I will link the blog once its ready.

### Why SpyderMaxi?

Spydermaxi is a web handle I used when I started playing Soul Calibur 2 in 2004. Spyder is the nickname; Maxi is [this character](https://soulcalibur.fandom.com/wiki/Maxi).
